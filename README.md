## Problem Statement

### Absence of Insights for the Relationship Between Student's Economic Background, Academic Performance, Competence & Expected Salary

Millions of students apply for internships and jobs every year. Resumes play a crucial role in forming the first impression. Recruiters spend a maximum of 2-3 minutes reviewing a resume after it lands in their mailbox or job board/ATS application. Surprisingly, more than 70% of resumes get rejected in the initial screening.

### Background

In the highly competitive job market, it is essential to pay attention to details and invest time in preparing a quality resume to pass the initial screening. Understanding the relationship between a student's economic background, academic performance, and other factors can provide valuable insights for both students and recruiters.

### Relevance

Gaining insights into the factors that influence student success can help in improving the quality of resumes and the chances of getting through the initial screening. It can also aid educational institutions in tailoring their support and resources to better prepare students for the job market.

## Analysis Questions

We have attempted the following questions to gain insights from the dataset:
**Easy Questions**

2. **What is the average GPA of the students?**
3. **What is the distribution of students across different graduation years?**
4. **What is the distribution of students' experience with Python programming?**
5. **What is the average family income of the students?**

### MODERATE QUESTIONS:

1. **How many students from various cities? (Solve using a data visualization tool).**
2. **How does the expected salary vary based on factors like 'GPA', 'Family income', 'Experience with Python (Months)'?**
3. **Which event tends to attract more students from specific fields of study?**
4. **Do students in leadership positions during their college years tend to have higher GPAs or better expected salaries?**
