## Problem Statement

### Absence of Insights for the Relationship Between Student's Economic Background, Academic Performance, Competence & Expected Salary

Millions of students apply for internships and jobs every year. Resumes play a crucial role in forming the first impression. Recruiters spend a maximum of 2-3 minutes reviewing a resume after it lands in their mailbox or job board/ATS application. Surprisingly, more than 70% of resumes get rejected in the initial screening.

### Background

In the highly competitive job market, it is essential to pay attention to details and invest time in preparing a quality resume to pass the initial screening. Understanding the relationship between a student's economic background, academic performance, and other factors can provide valuable insights for both students and recruiters.

### Relevance

Gaining insights into the factors that influence student success can help in improving the quality of resumes and the chances of getting through the initial screening. It can also aid educational institutions in tailoring their support and resources to better prepare students for the job market.
